## What is Glascript?
Glascript **[ Google Libraries For Apps Script ] - GLAS** is a website dedicated to helping Apps Script developers find, use, and share libraries.
<br/>
We believe that Apps Script libraries are a powerful way to improve the productivity of Apps Script developers. By providing a central location for developers to find, use, and share libraries, we hope to make it easier for developers to build better applications.

## Main Features

1. **Searchable library:** We have a searchable library of over 1,000 Apps Script libraries. You can search by library name, description, or tags.
2. **Upload your own libraries:** If you have developed an Apps Script library that you would like to share, you can upload it to our site.
3. **Automatic updates:** When a library you have installed is updated, we will automatically update it for you. This way, you can always be sure that you are using the latest version of the library.
4. **Dependency tracking:** We track the dependencies of each library in our library. This means that you can easily see which other libraries a library depends on.
